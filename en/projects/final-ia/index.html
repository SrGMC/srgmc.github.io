                    The project consisted in route finding in a logistical problem. Specifically, this is a problem in which a pizza delivery boy must deliver
                    all the orders from different stores to different customers. Several improvements were also implemented to the logistics problem, such as
                    different types of terrain and the use of electric motorcycles.
                </p>

                <h1>Design</h1>
                <p>
                    The project makes use of different types of search algorithms, specifically, depth search, breadth search, Greedy and A*. Together with
                    them, 11 different heuristic functions were developed, which were designed on the basis of asking the question
                    <i>If you were a pizza delivery man, which houses would you go to first?</i>
                    to different people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The aim of this project is to implement different algorithms to deal with static logistics problems and to analyse the results to observe
                    the influence of the heuristic functions and the performance of the different algorithms
                </p>
                <h1>Structure</h1>
                <p>The project is split into two parts:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Basic part: The problem is to deliver 1 to 3 pizzas to a single customer from a single pizza shop.</li>
                    <li>
                        Advanced part: The problem is to deliver orders from several customers from several pizza shops with only one delivery person. Each map
                        has special characteristics such as different difficulty terrains and limited distance vehicles.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    In addition, the problem is defined with maps, stored in text files where each character in this file corresponds to an element of the
                    problem, such as land, shops, customers, etc. More information can be found in the project repository.
